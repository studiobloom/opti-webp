# Opti-WebP

Opti-WebP is an image optimization tool that enables bulk resizing, compression, and conversion of non-WebP images to an optimized WebP format. 
It helps reduce image file sizes while maintaining visual quality, making it suitable for web development and optimization tasks.

## Features

- Bulk resize, compress, and convert non-WebP images to WebP format.
- Limit the maximum width/height of images while preserving aspect ratio.
- Supports various image formats, including PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, HEIC, TIFF, and TIF.
- Optimized images are saved as WebP format, providing smaller file sizes.
- Easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) for selecting the target directory and configuring the max dimension size.

## Usage

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/your-username/opti-webp/releases) page.
2. Extract the contents of the release package.
3. Run the `opti-webp.exe` executable.
4. Choose the directory containing the images you want to optimize.
5. Set the maximum dimension size (width/height) for the images. (500px-4000px is suggested)
6. Click the "OK" button to start the optimization process.
7. Opti-WebP will resize, compress, and convert the images to WebP format.
8. The optimized images will be saved in the same directory with "_resized.png" and ".webp" extensions.
9. Once the optimization process is complete, you can find the optimized images in the target directory.
